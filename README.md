# TensorFlow LadderEstimator
This project was getting dust on my laptop.
The project contains a TensorFlow implementation of the Ladder Network. The model is written conform the Estimator API which is easy to use.
## Ladder Networks
Ladder Networks are a structure of neural networks that allow to be trained with few labeled data. Simply explained they consist of a classical feedforward network combinded with a deep autoencoder.
A nice intro on the topic is available on YouTube:
